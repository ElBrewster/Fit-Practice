When I access one of the patterns from the API,
I want to see notes that other users left on the pattern 
and then have those notes available when you go to make the pattern

Helpful or irrelevant (because the most relevant is probably most relevant to all)

2 counters, only every go up, only one user can add a counter per note


Add my fiit notes


Since many sewing patterns are inaccurate reproductions of older patterns, I want to centralize that data on a site where users can add notes for other users to adjust their sewing plans based on the community notes

niche audience: Folks who like to sew & SewTubers who like patterns

mvp: 
As a user…I can navigate to the website to view all the patterns in the UI
As a user…I can click on a pattern and see the notes associated with that pattern
As a user…I can indicate whether the notes were helpful

after mvp:
I can add my own fit notes to a pattern
I can post patterns to the database (I would not be making a database, but posting to the API in this case)
